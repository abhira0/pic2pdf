## Usage
#### Executable File (.exe) for Windows
* Recent version doesn't support executable file
* Running executable file is as easy as running any executable on Windows 10
#### Source Code + Command Line Call = GUI
1. Download the source code named "pic2pdf.py" into a directory, say "sample_dir"
1. Open the command prompt inside "sample_dir"
1. Type in "python pic2pdf.py" and hit enter
1. A GUI must pop up, use it.
1. For the verbose, watch command line you opened to start GUI.

### Note:
* It can be slow when you open the application using executable. Wait for 5-20 seconds<br>
* Nevertheless, you can use python directly by using source code to make it faster<br>
